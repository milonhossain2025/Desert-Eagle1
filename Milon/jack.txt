# Captain Jack Sparrow 🏴‍☠️⚓
Ahoy! Welcome to my project 🚀🔥

Captain Jack Sparrow is a famous fictional pirate and the main character 
in Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean film series, played by actor Johnny Depp. 
He is known for his witty humor, clever tricks, and unpredictable personality. 
Unlike typical pirates who rely only on strength, Jack Sparrow uses intelligence,
cunning, and negotiation to survive. He loves freedom, the sea, and above all, 
his beloved ship — the Black Pearl. With his messy dreadlocked hair, braided beard,
kohl-lined eyes, and unique way of speaking, Jack Sparrow has become one of the
most iconic characters in movie history.
